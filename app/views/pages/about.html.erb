         I am currently studying Computer Science at CUNY Brooklyn.

         Apart from designing websites, I also hope to design software.

         Some of the languages I have experience in are:
       </p>
      <ul>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>Ruby</li>
        <li>Java</li>
      </ul>
     <p> Also check out what I'm currently doing: </p>

        Not only am I a student of Computer Science, I consider myself a student of life.
      I believe that everything ranging from books to people are learning experiences.
      Inspiration can strike us at any moment which is why I try to incorporate everything
      in my daily life into my work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also a bit of an adrenaline junky. I got my first taste when I rode a roller coaster for the first time and
        next thing I knew, I was wearing a parachute waiting to jump out of a plane.

 <blockquote cite="Marcus Aurelius">Concentrate every minute like a Roman – like a man – on doing what’s in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can – if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable." -Marcus Aurelius</blockquote>
